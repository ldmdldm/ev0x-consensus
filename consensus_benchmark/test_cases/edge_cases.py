"""
Edge Cases for Consensus Testing

This module contains test cases that focus on challenging edge cases:
1. Ambiguous or contradictory scenarios
2. Incomplete or uncertain information 
3. Time-sensitive or context-dependent answers
4. Extreme or boundary conditions

These test cases are designed to evaluate how well consensus mechanisms
handle situations where individual models might struggle or provide
inconsistent answers.
