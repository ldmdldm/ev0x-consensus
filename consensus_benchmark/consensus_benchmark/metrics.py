"""
Metrics module for evaluating model responses.

This module provides functions to calculate various metrics for evaluating
the quality of LLM responses, including accuracy, factual consistency,
hallucination rates, and reasoning quality.

def calculate_accuracy(responses: List[Dict], ground_truth: List[Dict]) -> float:

    Calculate the accuracy of model responses compared to ground truth.
    
    Args:
        responses: List of response dictionaries
        ground_truth: List of ground truth dictionaries
        
    Returns:
        Accuracy score (0.0 to 1.0)

    """
    Calculate the factual consistency of model responses.
    
    This evaluates if the response contains inconsistent or contradictory facts.

    Calculate the hallucination rate of model responses.
    
    Hallucinations are statements that are not grounded in provided context

    Calculate the consistency of model responses.
    
    This evaluates if the model gives consistent answers to similar questions.

    """
    Calculate the reasoning quality of model responses.
    
    This evaluates the logical coherence and step-by-step reasoning.

    Detect contradictory statements within a text.
